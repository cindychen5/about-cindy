    <h2>This is about Cindy, the most tech-savvy non-drug beer-lovin' gal west of the Mississippi.</h2>

    <p>I'm a city gal, born and raised in the Big Apple. I like drugs, a lot. That's why I moved to Albuquerque. Because
        I wanted to be nearer to Walter White. But then, after moving here in September, I realized that you can't get
        close to Walter, mostly because of Covid, but also because he's an elusive mo'fo. (I'm from NYC, we talk like that.)</p>

    <p> So, I decided to shack up with this dude that I've actually known for a long time, and now I've got a rock
        on my finger (not the Walter White kind of rock). He's from the 'Turkey (I can talk like that because I'm a local now),
        so his whole family is here and I thought his family might not like my previous profession, so, here I am!
        Getting out of drugs and into ...uhhh....this. I might need drugs to get through it.</p>

    <p>Also, I like beer (which is sort of a drug) and La Cumbre is my favorite beer. Hands down. Their Hefeweizen is nice
        for the morning, fruity, you know? And I prefer their Elevated IPA to get me through the afternoon, the stiff stuff.
        My daily stash is pictured above. I really like New Mexico now. (I also like the Oxford comma.)</p>

    <p><strong>P.S.</strong><br>
        This is what I made last night after I finished my stash. Cool!</p>
