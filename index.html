    <p>This is about Cindy.</p>

    <p>I was born and raised in NYC. I attended Northeastern University in Boston, MA and graduated with a doctorate in pharmacy.
        After 10 years in Boston, I recently moved to Albuquerque in September to be closer to family -- my fiance is originally from Albuquerque.
        I enjoy biking, hiking, running and trying new food. It's been a little hard to feel out the food scene here due to the pandemic but I
        have been able to explore the beer scene here. Some breweries I have been to include Bow and Arrow, Bosque, Steelbender, Kactus and Marble.</p>
